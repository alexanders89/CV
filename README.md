## Alexander Satur

I am a hard working and motivated Architecture graduate currently on the May 2017 Makers Academy Cohort looking to begin a career as a junior developer.

Originally from Sheffield I went to University in Leeds to study Architectural Technology which lead to a practice job in Harrogate and eventually to London where I worked as a kitchen designer for three years. After turning down a job with OMD I moved over to the then non existent operations side and started building the showrooms sales support and logistical tracking systems.
